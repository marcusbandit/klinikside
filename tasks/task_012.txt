# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Responsive Design and Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the website is fully responsive and displays correctly on all devices.
# Details:
Review and refine the responsive design of all pages to ensure they display correctly on all devices. Use Tailwind's responsive classes consistently throughout the site. Test on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and orientations. Implement any necessary adjustments to improve the mobile experience. Ensure text is readable and buttons/links are easily tappable on small screens. Verify that the navigation menu works well on all devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test the website on multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistent display and functionality. Use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes. Verify that all content is accessible and usable on mobile devices without horizontal scrolling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Establish Responsive Design System and Guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive responsive design system using Tailwind's responsive classes and establish guidelines for consistent implementation across the website.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Review current Tailwind configuration and ensure breakpoints are properly defined (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
2. Create a responsive design system document that outlines:
   - Standard container widths and max-widths for each breakpoint
   - Typography scaling across different screen sizes
   - Spacing/margin/padding adjustments for different viewports
   - Component-specific responsive behaviors
3. Establish naming conventions and patterns for responsive classes
4. Create reusable responsive utility classes if needed
5. Document responsive navigation patterns to be implemented
6. Set up a device testing matrix listing all devices and browsers to be tested

Testing approach:
- Review the design system with team members for feedback
- Validate that the proposed system addresses all responsive requirements
- Ensure the guidelines are clear and actionable for implementation

## 2. Implement Core Layout and Navigation Responsiveness [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Apply responsive design to the core layout components including header, footer, navigation menu, and main content containers.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Refactor the main layout components with responsive Tailwind classes:
   - Implement responsive header that collapses appropriately on smaller screens
   - Create mobile-friendly navigation menu with hamburger toggle for small screens
   - Ensure footer is properly responsive with appropriate column stacking
   - Set up responsive main content containers with proper padding/margins
2. Implement proper z-index management for mobile navigation overlays
3. Ensure navigation transitions are smooth across all breakpoints
4. Add touch-friendly tap targets (min 44x44px) for all navigation elements
5. Implement proper focus states for keyboard navigation

Testing approach:
- Test navigation usability across all breakpoints
- Verify hamburger menu functionality on mobile devices
- Check for any layout overflow issues
- Test keyboard navigation accessibility
- Verify touch targets are appropriately sized on mobile

## 3. Implement Page-Specific Responsive Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Apply responsive design to all page-specific components including cards, forms, tables, and other UI elements across the website.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Systematically review and refactor each page component:
   - Cards and content blocks should stack appropriately on mobile
   - Forms should adjust field widths and maintain usability on small screens
   - Tables should have horizontal scroll or responsive alternative views on mobile
   - Image galleries/carousels should be touch-friendly and properly sized
   - Modals and popups should be properly sized for mobile screens
2. Ensure consistent spacing between components at all breakpoints
3. Implement responsive typography that maintains readability (min 16px for body text on mobile)
4. Optimize button and form input sizing for touch interfaces
5. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover/active states

Testing approach:
- Test each component individually at various breakpoints
- Verify form usability on touch devices
- Check readability of all text elements
- Test interactive elements with touch input
- Verify that no content is cut off or inaccessible

## 4. Comprehensive Responsive Testing and Refinement [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Conduct thorough testing across multiple devices and browsers, document issues, and implement refinements to ensure consistent responsive behavior.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Set up testing environments:
   - Use browser dev tools for initial breakpoint testing
   - Test on actual physical devices when possible (iOS/Android phones, tablets)
   - Use BrowserStack or similar for additional device coverage
2. Create a testing checklist covering:
   - Portrait and landscape orientations
   - Different pixel densities (1x, 2x, 3x)
   - Touch interaction quality
   - Text readability at all sizes
   - Load time performance on mobile networks
3. Document all responsive issues in a spreadsheet with screenshots
4. Implement fixes for identified issues, prioritizing critical usability problems
5. Add responsive-specific unit tests where applicable
6. Optimize images and assets for mobile viewing (proper sizing, compression)

Testing approach:
- Follow the device testing matrix created in subtask 1
- Test all pages in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Verify functionality with touch, mouse, and keyboard inputs
- Test with screen readers to ensure accessibility
- Perform final cross-browser testing to catch any browser-specific issues
