# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Error Handling and 404 Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Create error handling mechanisms and a custom 404 page.
# Details:
Implement error handling throughout the application. Create a custom 404 page that matches the website's design and provides helpful navigation options. Implement error boundaries to catch and handle JavaScript errors. Add appropriate error messages for any potential user errors. Ensure all error states are handled gracefully and provide clear guidance to users on how to proceed.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling by intentionally triggering errors. Verify that the 404 page displays correctly when accessing non-existent routes. Check that error messages are clear and helpful. Ensure error states don't break the application's functionality.
