# Description: Implement Google Analytics to track website traffic and user behavior.
# Details:
Set up Google Analytics to track website traffic and user behavior. Create a Google Analytics account if one doesn't exist. Implement the Google Analytics tracking code using Next.js's recommended approach. Configure basic events tracking for important user interactions. Set up goals to track success metrics mentioned in the PRD (page views, unique visitors, bounce rate). Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR) by adding appropriate consent mechanisms if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that Google Analytics is correctly tracking page views and events. Test in both development and production environments. Check that data is being correctly reported in the Google Analytics dashboard.
