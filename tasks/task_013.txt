# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the website for performance to meet the target load time of under 3 seconds.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations to ensure fast loading times. Optimize images using Next.js Image component with appropriate sizing and formats. Minimize HTTP requests by combining CSS and JavaScript files where possible. Implement code splitting to reduce initial load size. Configure appropriate caching headers. Use lazy loading for non-critical content. Implement font optimization strategies.

# Test Strategy:
Use performance testing tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse to measure load times and identify bottlenecks. Verify that the website loads in under 3 seconds on average connections. Test performance on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Image Optimization with Next.js Image Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize all images across the website using Next.js Image component with proper sizing, formats, and lazy loading configuration.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Identify all image elements across the website
2. Replace standard <img> tags with Next.js <Image> components
3. Configure proper width and height attributes for each image to prevent layout shifts
4. Set appropriate sizes prop for responsive images
5. Configure priority prop for above-the-fold images
6. Set quality (75-85% is typically a good balance)
7. Use modern formats like WebP with fallbacks
8. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
9. Test image loading performance using Lighthouse and WebPageTest
10. Document image optimization guidelines for future development

## 2. Implement Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Reduce initial JavaScript payload by implementing code splitting, dynamic imports, and optimizing the bundle size.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Analyze current bundle size using tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer
2. Identify large dependencies that can be loaded on-demand
3. Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components using Next.js dynamic import functionality
4. Configure route-based code splitting for different pages
5. Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level code splitting
6. Review and optimize third-party dependencies (consider smaller alternatives)
7. Configure tree shaking to eliminate unused code
8. Set up proper chunking strategy in Next.js config
9. Measure bundle size reduction and load time improvements
10. Test functionality after code splitting to ensure everything works correctly

## 3. Implement Asset Optimization and Request Reduction [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Optimize CSS, JavaScript, and fonts while reducing the number of HTTP requests to improve loading performance.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Configure CSS optimization in Next.js (purge unused styles, minification)
2. Implement critical CSS extraction for above-the-fold content
3. Set up font optimization:
   - Use font-display: swap
   - Preload critical fonts
   - Consider using variable fonts
   - Subset fonts to include only necessary characters
4. Combine and minify CSS files where appropriate
5. Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect) for critical resources
6. Configure proper loading order for CSS and JavaScript
7. Implement inline critical CSS for fastest first paint
8. Set up font loading strategies to prevent render blocking
9. Test font loading performance and appearance
10. Measure reduction in HTTP requests and impact on load time

## 4. Implement Caching and Server-Side Optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Configure proper caching strategies, CDN integration, and server-side optimizations to further improve performance.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Configure appropriate caching headers for different asset types:
   - Long cache for static assets with versioning
   - Appropriate cache for HTML and API responses
2. Implement stale-while-revalidate caching strategy where appropriate
3. Set up CDN configuration for static assets
4. Configure Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic pages
5. Implement service worker for offline caching if appropriate
6. Configure compression (Gzip/Brotli) for text-based assets
7. Set up proper HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 support
8. Implement server timing headers for performance monitoring
9. Configure proper Next.js cache settings in next.config.js
10. Conduct comprehensive performance testing using:
    - Lighthouse
    - WebPageTest
    - Core Web Vitals metrics
    - Real user monitoring
11. Document the final performance improvements and compare to the 3-second target
